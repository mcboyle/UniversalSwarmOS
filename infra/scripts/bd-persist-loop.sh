# WHAT "EVERYTHING" MEANS HERE, learned the hard way: the codex worktrees are the
# volatile part. `git diff HEAD` cannot see a worker's UNTRACKED new files, and
# for several rows the new test file IS the cut -- so capture_codex.sh tars them
# separately. A capture loop piped into `head` also dies on SIGPIPE partway
# through, which silently lost 52 of 65 patches once; it writes then reads.
#
# Runs capture -> sync -> VERIFY, and logs the verify VERDICT, not the exit code
# of the last command. A capture that "succeeded" into an unrestorable archive is
# the failure this guards against.
